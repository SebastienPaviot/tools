# Tools Repository

Welcome to the **tools** repository, a collection of useful scripts designed to assist and accelerate my development research. This repository currently contains a script that analyzes the characteristics of devices (smartphones, tablets, or desktops).

## MediaDevices List

This script provides a detailed list of media devices (such as cameras, microphones, and speakers) available on your device. It utilizes the `navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()` method to fetch and display information about the connected media devices.

## beckfrontcamera

This script allows users to select between the front (user) or rear (environment) camera and display the video stream on the screen. The user can start the video stream by clicking the "Play" button, and stop it using the "Stop" button. It utilizes the getUserMedia API to access the camera and show the video in a <video> element. The camera selection is done through a dropdown menu. The video stream is displayed in real-time when activated.
